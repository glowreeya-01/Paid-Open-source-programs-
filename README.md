# Paid-Open-source-programs-

Contributing to Open source has proven effective in the growth of developers. Incredibly, developers worldwide can collaborate and improve the standard of technology. What is more impressive is that you could get paid for contributing to these open source projects. It is a win-win for me on every side.

There are Open source programs that enable contributors to contribute to a project and, at the same time, receive attractive incentives for it.

I have compiled a list of Paid Open Source programs you should consider applying to. They include:

Outreachy: This program organizes three-month paid internships with free and open-source software projects for people who are typically underrepresented in their projects.

1. Google Summer of Code(GSOC): This is another paid open source program where google awards stipends to contributors internationally who complete their projects during the summer. This program isn't just for students as it's available to everyone willing to contribute.

2. Google Season of Docs: GSOD allows open source projects to improve their documentation and enables technical writers to improve the documentation of these open source projects. This is a chance to gain more technical writing experience and get paid for it.

3. MLH Fellowships: MLH Fellowship is a three-month internship for selected fellows to work on real-life projects through open-source while getting paid.

4. Rails Girls Summer of Code: RGSoC encourages diversity in Open Source. It enables women and non-binary contributors to work on existing open-source projects while getting paid.

5. Reinforcement Learning Open Source Fest By Microsoft: This Microsoft-sponsored program introduces students to open-source reinforcement learning programs.

If you know of more paid open source programs, kindly fork this Repo, and contribute to this list.
